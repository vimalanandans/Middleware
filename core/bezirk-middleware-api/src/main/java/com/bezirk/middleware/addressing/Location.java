/**
 * A <code>Location</code> represents a <em>semantic address</em> that specifies the
 * physical location of a Thing or a set of Things. Typically, messages are broadcast
 * within a sphere and filtered per-Zirk based on the messages in the various
 * {@link MessageSet MessageSets} each Zirk is subscribed to, which may be too coarse-grained
 * for some cases. A semantic address is used to more precisely scope message recipients
 * after message-based filtering occurs.
 * <h1>Scopes</h1>
 * <p>
 * To spatially select a Thing or set of Things, a semantic address contains three levels of
 * spatial specificity:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <em>wide scope</em> denotes a large spatial area. For example,
 * the floor of a building (e.g. &quot;floor 1&quot;) represents a wide scope, which can
 * contain many Things.</li>
 * <li>An <em>intermediate scope</em> denotes a smaller spatial area. Building on the previous
 * example, specifying a room on floor 1 (e.g. &quot;kitchen&quot;) represents an intermediate
 * scope. There are usually fewer things in an intermediate scope than in a wide scope. However,
 * you can specify an intermediate scope without a wide scope; for example, specifying
 * &quot;kitchen&quot; without &quot;floor 1&quot; would select all the kitchens in a Zirk's
 * sphere(s), which may include several floors. In this case, you could potentially be selecting
 * more things.</li>
 * <li>A <em>narrow scope</em> denotes the smallest spatial area. Again building on the previous
 * example, specifying a specific part of the kitchen (e.g. &quot;window&quot; or
 * &quot;cake prep&quot;) completes the semantic address.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The actual names of scopes can be specified manually by the user or automatically by a service.
 * For example, a user that connects a light Zirk to a new light may be prompted to enter the
 * location of the light as a string. If the user is using a Zirk that provides location awareness
 * as a service, the names may instead be set by the location Zirk. The location of a Zirk
 * operating a Thing is set using {@link com.bezirk.middleware.Bezirk#setLocation(Location)}.
 * </p>
 * <h1>Representing Semantic Addresses as Strings</h1>
 * Semantic addresses are represented as strings by listing each scope in descending order
 * separated by a forward slash: <code>"wide scope/intermediate scope/narrow scope"</code>.
 * For example, using the scopes in the examples from the previous section, the semantic
 * addresses are represented by the following strings:
 * <code>"floor 1/kitchen/window"</code> and <code>"floor 1/kitchen/cake prep"</code>.
 * <h1>Specifying Scopes</h1>
 * The relative size of each scope is dependent on the specific spatial context surrounding the
 * semantic address. The previous examples were within the context of Things in a building; however
 * in a context where Things are traffic controls for municipalities, for example, the wide scope
 * may be a city, the intermediate scope a street, and the narrow scope a building number or
 * intersection.
 * <p>
 * Each scope is optional. If you do not specify any scope you are referring to all Things in
 * a sphere subscribed to the message's topic. This is equivalent to not using a semantic
 * address. However, any of the scopes may be skipped if necessary to define the desired set
 * of Things. Once again using the building example, the following addresses refer to different
 * sets of Things whose Zirks are within a sphere subscribed to the targeted topic:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>"floor1//"</code> refers to all Things on floor 1.</li>
 * <li><code>"floor1/kitchen/"</code> refers to all Things in floor 1's kitchen.</li>
 * <li><code>"floor1/kitchen/window"</code> refers to all Things in floor 1's kitchen
 * window.</li>
 * <li><code>"floor 1//cake prep"</code> refers to all Things in an any area called &quot;cake prep&quot;
 * on floor 1.</li>
 * <li><code>"/kitchen/cake prep"</code> refers to all Things in an area called &quot;cake prep&quot;
 * in rooms named &quot;kitchen&quot; anywhere in the building in the sending Zirk's sphere(s)</li>
 * <li><code>"//cake prep"</code> refers to all things in any area named &quot;cake prep&quot; in the
 * sending Zirk's sphere(s).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1>Practical Example</h1>
 * Setting a Thing's physical location during initial configuration is a typical reason to use
 * a semantic address. The exact contents of this address can come from user-input during a Zirk's
 * initial connection to the Thing, or from a Zirk providing location awareness services. In
 * practice, such a location-awareness Zirk will typically be trained beforehand to know the names
 * of each scope in some location (e.g. the names of floors and rooms on those floors). These names
 * can later be used to provide parameters for a <code>Location</code>. In this scenario, a Zirk first
 * connecting to a Thing will query the location service Zirk asking for the current location
 * and will use the reply to set starter wide, intermediate, and narrow scopes. The user can then
 * choose to override the initial values for any scope.
 * <pre>
 *     // ...
 *
 *     EventSet e = new EventSet(UserLocationEvent.class);
 *
 *     e.setEventReceiver((event, sender) -&gt; {
 *         final UserLocationEvent locationEvent = (UserLocationEvent) event;
 *         final Location userLocation = locationEvent.getLocation();
 *
 *         // Create a semantic address referring to all Things in the user's current
 *         // room
 *         final Location lightLocation = new Location(userLocation.getWideScope(),

 *                                               null);
